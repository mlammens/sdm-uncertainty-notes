# Ideas and Thoughts

## Sources of uncertainty

* inputs
    * presences
    * absences
    * background points
    * environmental layers
        * different sources for the same variables - i.e., temperature from WorldClim vs PRISM, etc.
* models



## Use of simulate species

* Consider using simulated species to examine spatial thinning parameters (see also written notes)
* What role could simulations have? I suppose the would limit one source of uncertainty - or allow us to control for it - which is species locations
